\"Sniping\" is the name given to the action of searching through foreign GBs for one in which you can get a return on for more than you would
normally have to invest (1.9 funding). Sounds complicated, but it is not.\n\nExample:\nPlayer A has at least a level 80 ark!\n\nPlayer B has a GB with a total of 200 deposited FP from 300 FP up to the level (i.e. 100 FP are still missing and there are no other players)\n1st place in this GB would give 60FP reward (i.e. 114FP with 1.9 Ark)\nPlayer A can ONLY deposit 50FP to secure P1 and can therefore make a profit of 64FP \n\nOf course, the whole thing only works when player B is active and the GB is also leveling.\n\nThe bot automatically takes the \"active\" flag into account, but it is still at your own risk, a player can go inactive at any time or decide not to level this GB."
